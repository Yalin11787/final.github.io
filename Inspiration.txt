I didn't think I had enough interesting personal credentials to base the content of the site on, so I chose to create an introductory site for a literary work I really like. 
This work greatly influenced my triad in the year I turned 18 and became an adult; I am able to empathize with every character, and my interests pretty much centered around this work.
Therefore, in a sense, this work also represents me as a person.
The story takes place in winter, and it snows whenever there's a major plot twist,so I decided to set the site on a winter night with snowflakes falling.
The name of this story is White Album, so the links at the bottom of the home page are presented as album photos.
Based on feedback from the last assignment, I set up a loader for the Twitter timeline so that visitors don't miss that part when it loads. 
I also added links to the weeklies, exercises, and a page of inspiration at the bottom of the front page as requested.
I chose to present these three links as images from the story in order to not ruin the overall vibe of the site.
