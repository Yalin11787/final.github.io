        I didn't think I had enough interesting personal credentials to base the content of the site on, <br>
so I chose to create an introductory site for a literary work I really like. <br>
This work greatly influenced my triad in the year I turned 18 and became an adult; <br>
I am able to empathize with every character, and my interests pretty much centered around this work. <br>
Therefore, in a sense, this work also represents me as a person.<br>
The story takes place in winter, and it snows whenever there's a major plot twist, <br>
so I decided to set the site on a winter night with snowflakes falling.<br>
 The name of this story is White Album, <br>
so the links at the bottom of the home page are presented as album photos.<br>
Based on feedback from the last assignment, <br>
I set up a loader for the Twitter timeline so that visitors don't miss that part when it loads. <br>
I also added links to the weeklies, exercises, and a page of inspiration <br>
 at the bottom of the front page as requested.<br>
 I chose to present these three links as images from the story in order to not ruin the overall vibe of the site.
