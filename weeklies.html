    <h2>Best thing happened this year<br>
        I got tickets to my favorite Japanese band's concert. <br>
        Unlike concerts in the United States, the Japanese concerts generally require a random selection of applicants who are eligible to buy tickets. 
        I used to sign up for many accounts when I participated in other sweepstakes, but most of the time I didn't get selected. This time, to avoid falling into the gloomy mood of trying but not getting results, I used only one account and left everything to fate. However, I was chosen. I have felt that I met them many times is destined, the lead singer girls' songs encouraged me to go through life one after another difficulties, without them there would be no today I. </h2>

        <h2>To be honest, I had a bad month in school.<br>
            Nothing good had happened before, <br>
            so I had no expectations for the future. <br>
            I had been living with the idea that I could live one day at a time. <br>
            But now that I have the motivation to live, <br>
            I'm going to try at least until the concert day in December. <br>
            I want to make a fan website for them with knowledge from class,<br>
             and publish my love and secondary creation for them.

            Thanksgiving Day<br>
            I've never had a proper Thanksgiving before. <br>
            One reason is that I'm not the kind of person who likes to celebrates holidays. <br>
            I hardly celeberate any of them. More importantly, <br>
            I had no one to celebrate with. My family members are in China. <br>
            My past rommates either went to be with their families or other friends. <br>
            But this year I found a rommate in the same situation to celebrate Thanksgiving with. <br>
            I'm really looking forward to it.

        <h2>The semester has finally come to a close. <br>
            To be honest, I've had a grueling time. <br>
            I don't seem to be gifted in my major field of study, <br>
            resulting in half-hearted efforts. As a result, <br>
            this class has become the easiest and most enjoyable class<br>
            I used what I learned to create introductory websites <br>
            for my favorite literary works, <br>
            which was very motivating while frustrating me in my major. <br>
            I originally had no interest in programming,<br>
             but this semester's manager gave me a new path.
